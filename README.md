# Urban8kNotebooks
This is a repository for my first foray into machine learning with audio. For my presentation, I utilized http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/AlexNet.html to create a nice visual representation of my CNN.

Note: These notebooks have wav files embedded into them. They will not be accessible on github. This is the reason there may be no output in some of the cells.
